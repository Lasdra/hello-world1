Basic + readme I forgot before

Hi.
I'm Felipe. I'm 32 and just taking my first steps towards becoming a programer.
I currently live in Jequi√© with my husband. I teach English for a living, but I'm also a licensed lawyer (even though I haven't done legal work in ages).
I like English, but it feels like there isn't much room for improvement in this area. I'm a teacher, I could become a coordinator and, if I can save enough money, I could open my own school. That's not a solid plan given how affected by the global situation the English teaching market has been.
